# this is for enumerate() instead of range()
#Why enumerate() is better:
# Readability: It directly gives you both index and value, making the code simpler and more readable.
# Efficiency: You donâ€™t need to use range(len()) to get the index, which is especially useful when you don't care about just the index.
